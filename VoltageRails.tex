In order to create 12V and 5V rails from the 48V unregulated batteries the LM2576HV was used as a buck converter to regulate and step down the voltage. However, the 3A maximum output current would not be enough to power all the systems within the vehicle. To resolve this issue several modules where used and daisy chained together in order to provide rails which can provide a sufficient amount of power for all the systems.
